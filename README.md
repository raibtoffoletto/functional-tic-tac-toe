# Functional Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple adaptation of the official [Intro to React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). However, it makes use of functional components and hooks instead of javascript classes, thus implementing a modernized way of writing React apps.

In this tutorial we will build a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. It assumes you are familiar with some React concepts and writing modern javascript (like modules, the spread operator **[...]** or arrow functions **( )=>{ }** ), also, how to use tools like git, npm and the command line.

**Setup**

You should have a local development evironment set up or use a service like [Codepen](https://codesandbox.io) or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) if you wish to follow on your browser.

_If you need help setting up your evironment, the official tutorial has a well written section dedicated to it._

The complete project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/raibtoffoletto/functional-tic-tac-toe) but we will start by cloning the Starter Code and installing the project's dependencies.

```bash
git clone --branch StarterCode https://github.com/raibtoffoletto/functional-tic-tac-toe.git

cd functional-tic-tac-toe/

npm install
```

You can run the project and see changes on real time in your browser by executing:

```bash
npm start
```

_By default a local server starts on port 3000, to override it, you can set the local variable PORT before executing the command._
