# Functional Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple adaptation of the official [Intro to React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). However, it makes use of functional components and hooks instead of javascript classes, thus implementing a more current way of writing React.

In this tutorial we will build a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. It assumes you are familiar with some front-end concepts and with writing modern javascript (knowledge of modules, the spread operator **[...]** or arrow functions **( )=>{ }** for example), also, it presumes that you understand tools like git, npm and the command line.

**Setup**

You should have a local development evironment set up or use a service like [Codepen](https://codesandbox.io) or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) if you wish to follow on your browser.

_If you need help setting up your evironment, the official tutorial has a well written section dedicated to it =D ._

The complete project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/raibtoffoletto/functional-tic-tac-toe) but we will start by cloning the Starter Code and installing the project's dependencies.

```bash
git clone --branch StarterCode https://github.com/raibtoffoletto/functional-tic-tac-toe.git

cd functional-tic-tac-toe/

npm install
```

You can run the project and see changes on real time in your browser by executing:

```bash
npm start
```

_By default a local server starts on port 3000, to override it, you can set the local variable PORT before executing the command._

## Starter Code

- So, what is React exactly?

The official tutorial defines React as _"a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces."_  So it is **just** a library, like JQuery, right? Well... not quite.

React is a very powerful library that lets you write for the web in a modular way. It is very particular in how it manages your components and their states, and later, how it compiles your application. It dynamically creates, updates, and removes DOM elements from your page, _REACTing_ to the user's actions and inputs.
